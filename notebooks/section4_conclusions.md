## Conclusions

The LROSE Science Gateway was developed to improve accessibility to weather radar and lidar analysis tools. By deploying JupyterHub servers on NSF cloud resources, we have simplified the procedure for hosting educational opportunities for students and community members. The LROSE Science Gateway provides a variety of tutorials in a format widely-used by the community and works to balance ease of use with guided instruction.

(methods summary)

The LROSE and NSF Unidata teams continue to explore how to make resources and tutorials most effective. ***Future development plans??*** Critically, the partnership between CSU, NSF NCAR EOL, and NSF Unidata allows for efficient use of team members' expertise.
